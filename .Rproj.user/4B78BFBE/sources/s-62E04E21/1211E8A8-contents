#' Intestinal Metaplasia Dataset
#'
#' This is part of the dataset used in the study by \insertCite{ribeiro2019omicsMA}{omicsMA}.
#'
#' It contains data from 10 two-color microarrays, being 5 from tissues representing
#' type II intestinal metaplasia and 5 from tissues representing the normal condition,
#' obtained from the Tumor Bank at A.C. Camargo Cancer Center / Antonio Prudente Foundation.
#'
#' Each sample is hybridized against a pool of normal tissues using the same orientation of
#' dye labeling. Gene expression levels were measured on Agilent Whole Human Genome
#' Microarrays 4x44K G4112F (design ID 014850).
#'
#' Each slide contais 45015 spots (41093 unique probes) and each spot contains
#'  about 60 foreground pixels.
#'
#' The scanned images of the microarray slides were processed by Agilent Feature Extraction
#' software, version 9.5, where statistics (mean, standard deviation and covariance) of the
#' foreground and local background pixels were computed for each spot, in both test and
#' reference channels.
#'
#' The experiment was conducted with financial support of the
#' Foundation for Research Support of the State of SÃ£o Paulo (FAPESP), grant 06/03227-2,
#' and in accordance with the recommendations of the international
#' guidelines for investigations involving human beings with written informed consent from all subjects.
#' The protocol was approved by the Ethics Institutional Committee of the A.C. Camargo Cancer Center
#' (process number 1023/07).
